Computer   Graphics   Final   Project
Introduction
This   project   demonstrates   a   comprehensive   application   of computer   graphics   techniques   learned   during   the   module.   The   implemented   application   showcases:
•      Basic   geometry   rendering.
•      Texture   mapping   for   enhanced   realism.
•      Lighting   and   shadow   mapping   using   Phong   shading.
•      Animation   and   user   interaction   (camera   control   and   object   movement).
•    An   advanced   feature:   Screen-Space   Ambient   Occlusion   (SSAO)   for   realistic   soft   shadows.
The infinite scene effect adds depth to the   user   experience   by   simulating   a   boundless   environment.    These features   are   integrated   to   create   a   visually   appealing   and   interactive   application.
Progress   Report
This   section   illustrates   the   development   stages   of the   project   with   accompanying   screenshots.
Stage   1:      Basic   Geometry   Rendering
The   initial   step   was   to   render   basic   geometries,   such   as   cubes   and   planes,   using   Vertex   Array   Objects   (VAOs)   and   Vertex   Buffer   Objects   (VBOs).

Stage   2:      Texture   Mapping
Textures   were   applied   to   the   rendered   geometries   using   STB   image   loading   to   enhance   realism.

Stage   3:      Lighting   and   Shadows
Phong shading was implemented to   simulate   realistic   lighting,   and   shadow   mapping   was   added   to   create dynamic   shadows.

Stage   4:      Animation   and   User   Interaction
Objects   were   animated   using   transformation   matrices,   and   us代 写Computer Graphics Final ProjectC/C++

Stage   5:      Advanced   Feature   (SSAO)
Screen-Space   Ambient   Occlusion   (SSAO)   was   added   to   enhance   the   realism   of   soft   shadows   and   depth   perception   in   the   scene.

Quality   and   Robustness
Quality
-   The   application   maintains   a   stable   frame   rate   of   15   FPS   on   compatible   hardware.   -   Features   such   as   shadow   mapping   and   SSAO   significantly   enhance   the   visual   quality.
Robustness
-   OpenGL   error   checking   ensures   stability   during   runtime.   -   Graceful   handling   of   missing   resources   (e.g.,   textures)   with   clear   error   messages.
-   Efficient   memory   management   avoids   resource   leaks.


Limitations   and   Future   Work
Limitations
•    Minor   artifacts   in   shadow   edges   due   to   resolution   constraints   of the   shadow   map.
•    SSAO   noise   in   areas   with   insufficient   samples.
Future   Work
•      Extend   the   application   with   dynamic   weather   effects,   such   as   rain   or   fog.
•   Improve   lighting   by   implementing   real-time   global   illumination.
•      Enhance   compatibility   for   WebGL   and   mobile   platforms.
